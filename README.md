# `pynb-dag-runner` Python library

🚧 🚧 WIP 🚧 🚧

## Development setup

The below VS Code/Docker based setup has been tested on Linux (Kubuntu), but should also work on MacOS with minor changes.

### In VS Code
- Open the root of this repository in VS Code.
- In the repo root run `make docker-build`.
- Ensure that the extension "Remote - Containers" (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers` published by Microsoft) is installed.
- Press the `><`-button in the lower left VS Code window corner. Select "Reopen in container".
- Inside container ensure that the "Python" extension is installed (`ms-python.python` also published by Microsoft). When installed and enabled, the lower row will show the Python version in use inside the container.
