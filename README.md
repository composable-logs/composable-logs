# `pynb-dag-runner` Python library

**py_dag_runner** is a open source Python library for running pipelines of Jupter notebooks. Main features:

### Tasks are executed in parallel using the [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) framework
 - With a DAG one can define in which order tasks should run.
 - Tasks run in parallel (subject to DAG constraints).
 - Currently `pynb-dag-runner` only support single node Ray clusters.

### Pipeline outputs are saved using the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) standard
- Pipeline telemetry is emitted using the OpenTelemetry (open) standard. This includes:
  - Pipeline configuration.
  - Parameters used to trigger tasks/notebooks.
  - Any logged images, metrics, rendered notebooks, or even models.
  - Timing and other outcomes (eg., did a task fail, succeed, timeout, any retries).
- Effectively, this means that after a pipeline has run all relevant information can be stored as one json file. Alternatively, this can be expanded into a directory structure, or the events can be redirected into any service that support OpenTelemetry (span events).
- Use of OpenTelemetry is possible since Ray supports OpenTelmetry.

### Reporting using custom static version of [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/)
- OpenTelemetry files emitted from pipeline runs can be converted into a static website (built using a custom version of mlflow).
- See [demo hosted on Github Pages](https://pynb-dag-runner.github.io/mnist-digits-demo-pipeline/).

----

The advantage of this approach is that pipelines can be be run without any cloud infrastructure except a Github account (see below).

The main limitation compared to other options, is that there is no real-time monitoring.

See [docs/NOTES.md](docs/NOTES.md) for further comments about the implementation and dependencies.

## ML Ops demo pipeline

The below shows an example ML pipeline that trains a model for detecting hand written digits. Moreover, it explores how the size of the training set influences model performance:

Using `pynb-dag-runner`, this pipeline is implemented in the below repo
- [mnist-digits-demo-pipeline](https://github.com/pynb-dag-runner/mnist-digits-demo-pipeline)

This repo has Github Actions conifgured to run the pipeline daily (on a Github hosted runner), and results are saved as build artifacts.

Past pipeline results can be inspected from the (static) mlflow site:
- [https://pynb-dag-runner.github.io/mnist-digits-demo-pipeline/](https://pynb-dag-runner.github.io/mnist-digits-demo-pipeline/)

This is built using the custom clone of mlflow [pynb-dag-runner/mlflow](https://github.com/pynb-dag-runner/mlflow).

(**Caveat:** The demo pipeline is currently being refactored. All steps have not yet refactored, and are not seen in the above links.)

## Development setup

Development environments are dockerized, and makefile:s should be available for most common tasks. See:

- [docs/LOCAL_UI_DEV.md](docs/LOCAL_UI_DEV.md): local development for developing mlflow frontend with static data

- [docs/LOCAL_DEV.md](docs/LOCAL_DEV.md): local development of main `pynb_dag_runner` Python library

The Github actions in the `pynb-dag-runner` and `mnist-digits-demo-pipeline` repos can also be useful since they show how various tests (unit, static code analysis) and pipelines are run in docker.

Instructions assume linux-based setup (eg. ubuntu), but should also work on macs with some changes (or at least on non-M1 ones).

## Contact

Please note that this is experimental and ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§.

A motivation for this work is to make it easier to set up and work together (on pipelines). If you would like to discuss an idea or question, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/pynb-dag-runner/mnist-digits-demo-pipeline/issues) or contact me via email.
