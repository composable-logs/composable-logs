# Projects with similarity to `pynb-dag-runner`

ML pipeline deployment tools (part of MLOps) are now actively developed.

Additions and corrections are welcome.

## Open source projects


### ZenML
- Also includes support for running pipelines on Github actions compute infra, [6/2022 blog post](https://blog.zenml.io/github-actions-orchestrator/). However, the setup seems to require cloud storage.

### SAME (**S**elf **A**ssembling **M**achine Learning **E**nvironments)

- Open source project to improve workflow for developing and deploying Jupyter notebooks. The SAME framework supports:

    - local notebook development with Jupyter notebooks;
    - easy deployment to production on various execution backends (like eg. Kubeflow, Azure functions, etc);
    - declarative configuration.

## Other

### Gitlab's MLOps initiative
- Gitlab is currently (7/2022) improving support for ML workflows.

    - This includes (plans for) better support for notebooks and per-repo MLFlow support.
